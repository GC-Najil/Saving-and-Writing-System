How this code work?

- This code work as a local database.
- app.py will ask you to create a database name.
- app.py will ask you to enter your name.
- app.py will ask you to enter your age.
- app.py will ask you to enter your key id.
- app.py will ask you to enter your password.

then this data will save in a .txt file, the text file name will be the database name.

you can access the data by running the appDisplay.py.

appDisplay.py will ask you to enter the database name and if it is wrong, it will exit the program, or if it is true, then it will show the data.

eg: ['Name : my name,' 'Age : my age,' 'Key ID : 1,' 'Password : my password']
